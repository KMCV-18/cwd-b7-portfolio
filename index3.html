            <p class="brown-text text-lighten-4"> <em> '. . . knowing clearly what I wanted I‚Äôve painted another three large canvases since then. They‚Äôre immense stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, and I made a point of trying to express sadness, extreme loneliness. You‚Äôll see this soon, I hope ‚Äì for I hope to bring them to you in Paris as soon as possible, since I‚Äôd almost believe that these canvases will tell you what I can‚Äôt say in words, what I consider healthy and fortifying about the countryside.'

            </p>
            <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> No matter how 'healthy and fortifying' Vincent found the countryside, it was to no avail. His illness and his uncertainty about the future became too much. <br>
                On 27 July 1890, he walked into a wheatfield and shot himself in the chest with a pistol. The wounded artist staggered back to his room at the Auberge Ravoux. Theo rushed from Paris to Auvers and was present when his brother died of his injuries on 29 July. </p> 
            <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> Vincent was buried at Auvers on 30 July 1890. His legacy was a large body of art works: over 850 paintings and almost 1,300 works on paper.

        <h3 class="light-green-text text-lighten-2" style="font-family:'Courier New'"> A Clue to van Gogh‚Äôs Final Days Is Found in His Last Painting </h3>
        <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> AMSTERDAM ‚Äî One hundred and thirty years ago, Vincent van Gogh awoke in his room at an inn in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, and went out, as he usually did, with a canvas to paint. That night, he returned to the inn with a fatal gunshot wound. He died two days later, on July 29, 1890.
            Scholars have long speculated about the sequence of events on the day of the shooting, and now Wouter van der Veen, a researcher in France, says he has discovered a large piece of the puzzle: the precise location where van Gogh created his final painting, ‚ÄúTree Roots.‚Äù 
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> There has long been debate about which painting was van Gogh‚Äôs last work, because he tended not to date his paintings. Many people believe it was ‚ÄúWheatfield With Crows,‚Äù because Vincente Minnelli‚Äôs 1956 biopic ‚ÄúLust for Life‚Äù depicts van Gogh, played by Kirk Douglas, painting that work as he goes mad, just before killing himself.
        </p>
        <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> In 2012, the Van Gogh Museum published a paper by Mr. van Tilborgh and Bert Maes arguing that the letter referred to ‚ÄúTree Roots,‚Äù an unfinished painting in the museum‚Äôs collection. That claim has now largely been accepted by scholars.

        <h5 class=" grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> ‚ÄúTree Roots‚Äù was painted on the Rue Daubigny, a main road through Auvers-sur-Oise, which is about 20 miles north of Paris, Mr. van der Veen found. The tangled, gnarled tree roots and stumps can still be seen in the slope of a hill there today, just 500 feet from the Auberge Ravoux, where van Gogh spent the last 70 days of his life.
