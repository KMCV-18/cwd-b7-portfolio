He was not the first child of the Protestant minister Theodorus van Gogh and Anna Carbentus: another son (also named Vincent) had been stillborn on the same date, precisely one year earlier. <br> Happily, the birth of the second Vincent went smoothly, and was followed by that of three sisters and two brothers: Anna, Theo, Wil, Lies and Cor. </p>

        <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> At the tender age of eleven, Vincent made a significant     transition from the village school in Zundert to a boarding school in Zevenbergen. Unfortunately, he found little solace at the new school, and though he managed to complete his elementary education, his time there was marked by profound unhappiness. While he occasionally engaged in drawing, there were no apparent signs of any exceptional artistic talent at that point. <br>
        At the age of thirteen, Vincent enrolled in a secondary school in Tilburg, where he displayed remarkable proficiency in languages and achieved commendable grades. Despite his academic success, for reasons unknown, he decided to abruptly leave the school halfway through his second year (1867-1868), and he never returned to formal education thereafter. </p>

        <br>
        <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> During the period of 1864-1866, Vincent attended a boarding school situated on Stationsstraat in Zevenbergen, with the white building on the left serving as the institution where he was a student.

            <p class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> At the age of sixteen, Vincent's uncle played a pivotal role in securing him a trainee position at the renowned international art dealer, Goupil & Cie. He was fortunate to be employed at the branch established by his affectionately nicknamed 'Uncle Cent' (short for 'Vincent') in The Hague. It was during these initial years at Goupil that Vincent wrote his earliest surviving letter. <br>
            The turning point came in September 1872 when Vincent's younger brother, Theo, initiated a lifelong exchange of letters between them. Theo, too, joined Goupil in 1873, but this time in Brussels. Subsequently, Vincent was transferred to Goupil's London branch in that same year. The Van Gogh brothers' association with Goupil would significantly shape their careers and influence the course of art history. </p> </div>

                    <p class="light-green-text text-lighten-2"> Theo was the manager of Goupil art dealers (later Boussod, Valadon & Cie) on the Boulevard Montmartre in Paris. He introduced his brother to the colourful work of prominent modern artists like Claude Monet. Vincent van Gogh also got to know a new generation of artists at Fernand Cormon’s studio, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Emile Bernard. <br>
                    All those new impressions and new people had an influence on his own work and inspired him to experiment freely. The dark tones of The Potato Eaters quickly gave way to brighter colours, as in The Hill of Montmartre with Stone Quarry. </p>

                        <p class="light-green-text text-lighten-2"> Vincent’s work grew steadily brighter in Paris, under the influence of modern art. He used brighter colours and developed his own style of painting, with short brush strokes. <br>
                        The themes he painted likewise changed, with rural labourers giving way to cafés and boulevards, the countryside along the Seine and floral still lifes. He also tried out more ‘commercial’ subjects, such as portraits. Vincent mostly acted as his own sitter, however, as models were relatively expensive. Meanwhile, he discovered a new source of inspiration in Japanese woodcuts, which sold in large quantities in Paris. </p>

                    <p class="light-green-text text-lighten-2"> In May 1890, Vincent departed from the mental hospital in Saint-Rémy and went to Auvers-sur-Oise, a town where several artists had already taken up residence. Auvers provided him with the tranquility he sought, yet it remained conveniently close to Paris, allowing him to visit his brother, Theo. Moreover, the presence of a doctor in Auvers, Paul Gachet, offered Vincent a sense of reassurance as Gachet could keep a watchful eye on him. Soon, Vincent forged a close friendship with Dr. Gachet, who was also an amateur painter. <br>
                    Gachet encouraged Van Gogh to fully dedicate himself to his artistic pursuits, and the advice resonated deeply with Vincent. Vicent then, fervently painted the beautiful gardens and wheatfields that surrounded the village. Vincent devoted himself to his craft, completing an impressive work nearly every day. His physical and mental well-being went better, and was driven by an unwavering passion for his art. </p>

                <p class="brown-text text-lighten-4"> Vincent spent the final months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise: an artists' village near Paris. He made new friends and he threw himself into painting. Yet after a visit to Theo, Vincent grew very concerned about his financial future. This uncertainty became too much to bear on top of his problems with his mental health. Vincent ended his life in July 1890.

                </h5>
                <p class="light-green-text text-lighten-2">Vincent visited Theo and his family in Paris in early July 1890, where he learned that his brother was thinking of quitting his job at the art dealers’ he had managed over many years. <br>
                Theo wanted to set up his own business, which inevitably represented a certain financial risk. Vincent returned to Auvers a worried man. </p> <br>
                <p class="brown-text text-lighten-4"> <em> 'Once back here I too still felt very saddened, and had continued to feel the storm that threatens you also weighing upon me. What can be done – you see I usually try to be quite good-humoured, but my life, too, is attacked at the very root, my step also is faltering. '
                </em> </p> 
                <p style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 13px;" class="yellow-text text-lighten-4"> Vincent to Theo, Auvers-sur-Oise, around 10 July 1890
                </p> <br>
                <p class="light-green-text text-lighten-2"> Both Theo and his wife Jo wrote to Vincent to reassure him. But financial uncertainty and fear that his nervous attacks might return took a heavy toll on Van Gogh’s health. He could not shake off his gloom about the future.
